## VGG16 in TensorFlow

This a tensorflow model of the 16-layer convolutional neural network used by the VGG team in the ILSVRC-2014 competition.

I wrote up this model with strong reference to Davi Frossard's post on https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frossard/post/vgg16/. 

The *imagenet_classes.py* module, example image input *laska.png* and pretrained weights *vgg16_weights.npz* are all obtained from the link mentioned.
