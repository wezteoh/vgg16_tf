# VGG16 in TensorFlow

This a tensorflow model of the 16-layer convolutional neural network used by the VGG team in the ILSVRC-2014 competition.

I wrote up this model with strong reference to Davi Frossard's post on https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frossard/post/vgg16/. 

The imagenet_classes.py module and example image input laska.png are both obtained from the link.
